CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.21 (since EDGE-Classic 1.2)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
+ Fixed issues when launching from a location other than the executable directory on non-Windows builds
+ Fixed rare ceiling crusher-related bug
+ Text based menus for <Episode select> and <Difficulty select> were not working if the Main menu was using custom graphics
+ Fixed null string CTD in HUD_DrawText and font_c::StringWidth
+ Fixed issue with FS_ReadDir returning relative paths
+ Restored "Hudless" option in COALHUDS HUD cycling

General Improvements
--------------------
+ Improved STYLES.DDF functionality across console and menus; backgrounds images/colors and translucency are no longer hardcoded
+ Added "Edge" UDMF namespace detection in preparation for EDGE-Classic's UDMF spec
+ Improved menu cursor positioning and scaling
+ Back mid-texture on a Glass line type is automagically mirrored
+ Load/Save menu will use DDFLANG difficulty strings instead of hard-coded Doom strings when showing savegame details
+ Improved CMD_Dir result display
+ DOOMWADDIR and DOOMWADPATH will now be evaluated together instead of separately
+ If no -iwad parameter is given, an IWAD will be selected from all IWADs discovered in default search paths based on a scoring/preference system
  - Doom 2/Freedoom Phase 2/Final Doom are highest priority due to highest compatibilty with mods/PWADs
  - Doom 1/Freedoom Phase 1 are second in line
  - Remaining Doom-based IWADs (HacX/Harmony for now) are third
  - Heretic/Blasphemer, being the newest games supported, are after those
  - If a new custom standalone IWAD (with EDGEIWAD lump) is present in the search list, it will be considered last

New Features
------------
+ Custom standalone IWADs can be created by adding an EDGEIWAD lump to the WAD. This will allow it to pass the automatic IWAD
  detection

+ STYLES.DDF
  - New properties: X_OFFSET and Y_OFFSET. Will set all menu entries in this style to the same x/y offset.
  - New SPECIAL flag: NO_STRETCH_FULLSCREEN, which will disable default behaviour of stretching backgrounds to fill the screen
  
+ Lines.ddf
  -Added 3 new BREAKABLE glass line types: 
  [830] Breakable Glass: monsters can see through it and can break it
  [831] Breakable Glass: monsters: cannot see through it but can break it
  [832] Breakable Glass: monsters: cannot see through it and cannot break it

+ Sectors.ddf
  -Added 6 new coloured sector types:
  [4471] EDGE Blue Hue
  [4472] EDGE Green Hue
  [4473] EDGE Red Hue
  [4474] EDGE Yellow Hue
  [4475] EDGE Purple Hue
  [4476] EDGE Grey Hue
