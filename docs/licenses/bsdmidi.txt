Description             : This is some code I wrote for Freedoom to
                          generate a free "GENMIDI" lump for Doom.  The
                          source data is based on the register values from
                          the OpenBSD OPL driver. The result isn't too
                          great; the original GENMIDI is definitely miles
                          better, but it's somewhat acceptable.

Additional Credits to   : OpenBSD/NetBSD projects, specifically the authors
                          of the OPL driver.
