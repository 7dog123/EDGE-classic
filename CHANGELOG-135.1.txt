CHANGELOG for EDGE 1.35.1 (since 1.35)
====================================

(Date: NOVEMBER 2021)


Bugs fixed
----------
- TuttiFrutti effect. When the texture was shorter than the wall it was being applied to, the blank space was either filled with black or left invisible causing all sorts of graphical anomalies. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.

- OUCH face on the hud was using incorrect damage value.

- Face on hud never looked left because random number was never > 1.

- Linetypes [268](Monster-only Silent Teleport W1 (Boom)) and [269](Monster-only Silent Teleport WR (Boom)) were incorrectly set as PUSH instead of WALK.

- Sliding doors activated by monsters now make the appropriate SFX.

- Crash-to-desktop bug when using WEAKNESS class finally fixed.

- Black screen after endgame: backported from 2.x branch.

- oof sfx behaviour now closer to original doom.

- Dropping the console with a movement key held down would preserve that movement while in the console. Now toggling the console properly drops (movement) input

- Games with only one selectable episode will now skip episode selection and proceed directly to the skill choice menu. This prevents the "Hell on Earth" episode from appearing
  when it is not appropriate.

General Improvements
--------------------
+ Added more ammotypes:  Now we have from AMMO01 to AMMO24.

+ Ignore COAL bobbing commands "cam.set_vert_bob" and "cam.set_roll_bob"

  -Revamped Overlay hud.
  -Removed AIRBAR graphics from edge.wad and rewrote the coal function to not use them.
  -Splash footsteps sfx when walking on liquid flats.

+ Lines.ddf
  -Edited all Slider doors to use BDOPN sfx.
  
+ Removed #VERSION check for both DDF and RTS. 

+ Made single option RTS MENUs respond to KEYD_JOY4 button.

+ Reduced Arachnotron width by 1. (Even though technically it is 64, this avoids issue with some pwads).

+ Reduced the lighting on several enemy attacks.

+ Default monitor ratio is set to 16:9 instead of 4:3 to accommodate most modern monitors.

+ Dynamic lighting, HQ2x, and Smoothing are now on by default to better highlight some of EDGE's rendering features.

+ Sliding doors now show on the Automap. 

+ Quietly ignore music lumps which aren't MIDI/OGG/MP3 instead of erroring out to Desktop.

+ Reduced the red tint while using the berserk power up.

+ M_SKULL1 menu cursor now uses DDFANIM (instead of being hardcoded to 2 frames). 

+ Much improved Doom skyboxes from https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=53873&hilit=doom+skyboxes

+ Merged CeeJays lines.ddf with ours to create the ULTIMATE lines.ddf ;)

+ doom_ddf folder content merged into edge.wad and the folder removed. The past is the future...again ;)

New Features
------------
+ More game IWADs supported: HACX, Herectic, Harmony.
  -HACX: full support. Includes bug fixes and widescreen support by CeeJay. Some graphics credited to HACX 2 team.
  -Harmony: Full support. May be some (hopefully) minor differences.
  -Heretic: parcial support. Item inventory doesn't work.
  
+ THINGS.DDF: 
  -FALLING_SOUND for the player when they fall long distances. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
  -SECRET_SOUND entry for the player which plays when he enters a sector marked SECRET. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch. DSSECRET SFX from K8vavoom.
  -New SPECIAL flag: IMMORTAL. This thing never recieves damage from any attacks, but will go into pain states etc as usual.
  -New SPECIAL flag: FLOOR_CLIP. This things sprites will always stick to the floor in the case that it's too tall for the sector it's in.

+ WEAPONS.DDF: new DJNE weapon action for more robust weapon reloading. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
Used just like JUMP(state_name:frame,xx%), but decrements the reload quantity for the specified attack and jumps if it's not zero. The jump chance is now interpreted as the attack specifier: 0% is the primary attack ammo, and non-zero percent is the secondary attack ammo.

  - New Command "EXIT_GAME": exits out of the map and back to the main title screen.

+ New MIDI Player

  - A Roland SC-55 style default soundfont by Deemster has been included (https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=45600).

  player.kills() returns how many enemies killed on the current map.
  player.secrets() returns how many secrets discovered on current map.
  player.items() returns how many items picked up on the current map.
  player.map_enemies() returns total enemies on current map.

  hud.draw_number(x, y, len, num, align_right). hud.draw_num2() always 
    starts drawing the numbers from right-to-left. This new function 
    allows left-to right if we pass 0 for the align_right parameter, 
    or the usual draw_num2() right-to-left if we pass 1.
  math.random2() returns a random number between 0 and 10.
  hud.game_paused() returns 1 if the game is currently paused or 
    on the title menu screen.
