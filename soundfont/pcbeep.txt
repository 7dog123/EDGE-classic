P.C. Speaker
============

SF2 and MID Copyright (C)1998, Rich ¥Weeds¥ Nagel - All rights reserved

This sound bank was created from nothing but a 1/2 second P.C. speaker beep,
and requires 29KB of AWE-32 RAM.

The presets in the sound bank are:

0 = P.C. Speaker Beep
1 = P.C. Speaker Chime
2 = P.C. Speaker Synth
3 = P.C. Speaker Drum
4 = P.C. Speaker Pop

Load PCBEEP.SF2 into "User Bank 001", and then play the demo MIDI (PCBEEP.MID)
with any MIDI player. Surprising, isn't it <BG>?


Enjoy!
