=======================================
EDGE Pack Structure and Usage (Draft)
=======================================

by The EDGE Team.  April 2023.

=======================================
Introduction
=======================================

The term "Pack" is used to refer to both compressed archives and whole directories that are passed
to the program via the -file and -dir parameters, drag-and-drop, response files, et cetera. They are
handled in the same manner by the underlying program, and as such follow the same file heirarchy and
usage patterns.

=======================================
Supported Archive Formats
=======================================

Zip-compressed archives with the following extensions are recognized and loaded by the program:

.epk - An abbreviation of "EDGE PacKage"; this is the preferred extension to differentiate EDGE-specific
       archives from archives supported by other source ports. Currently works with SLADE; other editing
       tools may not recognize this by default (yet).

.pk3 - The most common extension recognized by various editing tools, but runs a high risk of being mistaken for a 
       file meant to be used with the ZDoom family of ports.

.zip - The default format for files from the /idgames archive, this should also be easily loaded by most editing tools.
