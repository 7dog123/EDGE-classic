CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.36 (since EDGE-Classic 1.35)
====================================


New Features
------------
- ATTACKS.DDF: 
  - DAMAGE_UNLESS_BENEFIT and DAMAGE_IF_BENEFIT subcommands added
    - Can be used anywhere that DAMAGE is used (sectors, attacks, etc)
    - DAMAGE.DAMAGE_UNLESS_BENEFIT: Player will take damage unless they have at least one of the benefits listed
    - DAMAGE.DAMAGE_IF_BENEFIT: Player will take damage if they have at least one of the benefits listed
  - Attack special "PLAYER_ATTACK" makes attack behave as if originating from the player, even if 
    it's an indirect secondary attack i.e. the player gets his VAMPIRE health and KillBenefits.
  - DAMAGE.FLASH_COLOUR field added (Courtesy of akaAgar - https://github.com/edge-classic/EDGE-classic/pull/576)
    - Allows a custom color to be used as the pain effect when a player is hit by this damage type
    - Can be used to emulate effects like Hexen's cold/poison damage

- WEAPONS.DDF: 
  - Can now define a 3RD and 4TH attack. Equivalent DDF syntax to SEC_xxx used for second attack
    - DDF Fields: 
      - 3RD_ATTACK, 3RD_AMMOTYPE, 3RD_AMMOPERSHOT, 3RD_CLIPSIZE, 3RD_AUTOMATIC, 3RD_SPECIAL
      - 4TH_ATTACK, 4TH_AMMOTYPE, 4TH_AMMOPERSHOT, 4TH_CLIPSIZE, 4TH_AUTOMATIC, 4TH_SPECIAL
    - DDF States:
      - 3RD_ATTACK, 3RD_RELOAD, 3RD_DISCARD, 3RD_WARMUP, 3RD_FLASH
      - 4TH_ATTACK, 4TH_RELOAD, 4TH_DISCARD, 4TH_WARMUP, 4TH_FLASH
    - DDF Actions:
      - 3RD_SHOOT, 3RD_REFIRE, 3RD_NOFIRE, 3RD_NOFIRE_RETURN, 3RD_CHECKRELOAD, 3RD_FLASH
      - 4TH_SHOOT, 4TH_REFIRE, 4TH_NOFIRE, 4TH_NOFIRE_RETURN, 4TH_CHECKRELOAD, 4TH_FLASH
    - For consistency, all the old SEC_xxx ddf commands can also be used with 2ND_xxx instead 
      - i.e. 2ND_AMMOTYPE can replace SEC_AMMOTYPE
  - REFIRE_TO state added
    - Uses same syntax as JUMP, but uses refiring instead of % chance as the test condition
    - SEC/2ND_REFIRE_TO, 3RD_REFIRE_TO, and 4TH_REFIRE_TO also supported

- GAMES.DDF: "NO_SKILL_MENU" boolean command added (Courtesy of akaAgar - https://github.com/edge-classic/EDGE-classic/pull/577)
  - If true, will skip difficulty menu and start selected episode at skill 2 ("Hurt Me Plenty" for Doom)
  - Intent is for mapsets that have a Quake-style initial skill-select level or where the author may not implement/want
    to present skill levels
  - Default value is false

- RSCRIPT: "EXACT_" prefix added for ON_CONDITION checks (Courtesy of akaAgar - https://github.com/edge-classic/EDGE-classic/pull/578)
  - Allows check for the exact value of a benefit/etc, versus the default of greater-than-or-equal

- THINGS.DDF: 
  - New Action command: SET_PAINCHANCE(percentage) which will dynamically change a monsters painchance.
    Possible usage: if we do SET_PAINCHANCE(0%) at the start of a lengthy PAIN state, this will make sure the 
	whole animation is played out and won't be interrupted by another shot which would normally make us 
	re-start the pain animation again. Remember to set it back to normal at the end of the lengthy animation.
  - New Special flag: IMMOVABLE which will make this thing be unaffected by thrust from attack impacts 
    irrespective of whether it has a small MASS or a very large one.


General Improvements/Changes
--------------------
- Detection/functionality for mikoportals implemented
  - Voodoo dolls that fall onto a floor at exactly -32768 will preserve their X/Y/Z momentum and be moved to their sector's ceiling
    - Friction and drag ("air friction") will not be applied to voodoo dolls in this situation
  - Regular players and things will adhere to normal physics
- Windowed Mode resolution list will now dynamically populate based off of available display information instead of using presets
- Video Options crosshair selection will not be shown when switching to/from weapons that have DDF custom crosshairs
- Slightly re-organized the Key binding menu to accomodate the new 3rd and 4th attacks.
- Implemented 'episode' UMAPINFO key; EDGE-Classic now fully supports the UMAPINFO spec, Revision 2.2
- ZMAPINFO/MAPINFO parsing updates:
  - Episode definitions and the 'clearepisodes' directive will now be respected
  - ZMAPINFO 'ResetInventory' level definition key will result in the RESET_PLAYER DDFLEVL command being applied
- Heretic: numerous improvements and tweaks courtesy of DW user Macro (https://github.com/Macro914/EDGE-Classic-Scripting-Patches)
- YMFM:
  - Added "Apogee" instrument bank, based on Apogee Sound System and AdPlug instruments
  - Removed "AdPlug", "WadSmoosh", and "DMXOPL3" instrument banks
  - Replaced "DMXOPL" instrument bank with one tailored to vanilla/single OPL3 chip limits
  - Removed ability to load WOPL instrument banks as it was only partially implemented
- COLMAP.DDF: Colormap entries with no gl_colour, lump, or pack file defined will no longer throw an error
  - New behavior is to remove all existing colormap entries with the same name
    - Intent is to be able to define a colormap as "nothing", even if prior entries had a definition
  - Colormap entries later in the load/parsing order with the same name will still be added


Bugs fixed
----------
- Legacy bugfix: Boom generalized sector types were not preserved when saving/loading levels with said sectors
- Fixed assertion failure when referencing DSDehacked frames past the last frame explicitly defined in the [CODEPTR] section
- Fixed viewpoint modified by the r_fov CVAR not changing the vertical view slope appropriately
- Fixed region properties not working properly with a vertex sloped floor that rises above its sector's original floor height
- Fixed occasional sector glow thing link/unlink errors
- Fixed AJBSP using self-referencing linedefs that were perfectly vertical or horizontal for partitioning
- Fixed floor/ceiling rotation not working when using images that have a different width and height
- Fixed MODEL_ROTATE not being applied to attacks
- Fixed savegames not preserving the 'is_voodoo' convenience boolean for mobjs, causing issues when loading a game that had them present
- Fixed berserk and other powerup effects not modifying model colors accordingly (bug introduced by transition to VBOs for model rendering)
