CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.35 (since EDGE-Classic 1.34)
====================================


New Features
------------
+ ATTACKS.DDF
  - New attack type - DUALATTACK
    - Can execute two independent attack definitions with a single state
    - New parameters (only required when using DUALATTACK):
      - DUALATTACK1=<string> - First dual attack definition
      - DUALATTACK2=<string> - Second dual attack definition
    - DUALATTACK1/2 must both be present, even if referring to the same attack
    - A dual attack can execute other dual attacks, but cannot reference itself
  - New attack type - PSYCHIC
    - Instant ranged direct damage attack
    - Will not cause infighting

+ Chex Quest 1 supported as an IWAD
  - Chex Quest 2 support as a PWAD for Chex Quest 1
  
+ RTS 
  - New command: REPLACE_THING <oldThing> <newThing>, which will replace all oldThings on the current map with newThings.
    Will be mainly used at map start and it is substituting the thing, not transforming it. For randomizer scripts.
	
+ THINGS.DDF
  - New state action: UNBECOME, which will return a thing to it's original type if it has suffered a BECOME() previously.
    If it has not been BECOMEd previously then nothing will happen.
  - New state action: MORPH: identical behaviour to BECOME, except HEALTH is filled up.
  - New state action: UNMORPH, which will return a thing to it's original type if it has suffered a MORPH() previously.
    If it has not been MORPHed previously then nothing will happen.
  - New command: MORPH_TIMEOUT: when this timer is reached, the thing will go to a "MORPH" state if it has one defined.
    If it has no "MORPH" state then the thing is simply removed.
  
  

General Improvements/Changes
--------------------
- Weapons with the ability to zoom but without a ZOOM state defined will still draw the regular psprite and crosshair while zoomed
- Implemented remaining MBF code pointers (A_FireOldBFG, A_BetaSkullAttack)
- Implemented new DEHEXTRA Thing fields:
  - Gib health
  - Dropped item
  - Pickup width
  - Projectile pass height
  - Fullbright
- Fluidlite replaced with Primesynth for soundfont MIDI synthesis
  - SF3 support has been dropped
- PC Speaker Mode will now disable music while active to prevent non-MIDI formats from playing
  - "Bonkers for Bits" soundfont has been removed
- "microGM" soundfont added as a more SNES-like option
  - "16 Bit Game Station" soundfont has been removed
- "ChipFreak" chiptune/8-bit inspired soundfont added
- FMMIDI player has been removed in favor of adding OPL3/SF2 files that cover the same general sound


Bugs fixed
----------
- BOOM linetypes 143, 144, 148 and 149 fixed to use the correct Tx0/Tx changer type
- Removed 'WALL' as a recognized glow type in DDFTHING to prevent potential blockmap issues
  - This references unused code and thus had unpredictable results
- Removed ability for multiple glow types to be assigned to a DDFTHING definition
- GLASS lines were not working with projectiles if no EFFECT_OBJECT was defined.
