CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.34.2 (since EDGE-Classic 1.34.1)
====================================


New Features
------------
- "Extra Blood" under Gameplay Options renamed to "Blood Level" and "None" added to 
  the list of choices
  - Setting to None will disable blood splats, death and overkill states; enemies
    will instead teleport out of existence on death (similar to Chex Quest)
- "Sky Scaling" added to Video Options menu, replacing the previous methods of drawing
  non-skybox skies. The following choices are available:
  - Mirror: Will invert the sky texture at the horizon, scaled to account for vertical mouselook.
  - Repeat: Will repeat the sky texture at the horizon, scaled to account for vertical mouselook.
  - Stretch: Will stretch from top to bottom to avoid texture repeat, scaled to account for vertical
    mouselook. Does not preserve the original width/height ratio of the image.
  - Vanilla: Will draw the sky texture once, but does not scale or otherwise account for vertical mouselook.
  - For all options, the top and bottom of the faux skybox will have an appropriately color-matched cap.
  - The Vanilla option will be forced when mouselook is disabled.
  - Sky stretching for a level can be overridden via the new DDFLEVEL SKY_STRETCH special, using
    the names above.
- New console command "openhome": will open the folder where EC is storing its home data
  - In portable mode, this will open the directory where the executable is located
- ATTACKS.DDF
  - New PROJECTILE_SPECIAL flag: PRESERVE_MOMENTUM
    - Will add the x/y/z momentum of the projectile attack source to the newly created projectile
- WEAPONS.DDF
  - New command: IGNORE_CROSSHAIR_SCALING = \<boolean\>
    - If this weapon has custom crosshair sprites, they will not be affected by Video menu option "Crosshair Size".
- Added support for the vWAD format as a recognized archive for pack file usage
  - Description of vWAD specification can be found at the top of https://github.com/edge-classic/EDGE-classic/blob/master/source_files/libvwad/vwadvfs.h
- Implemented sector and level-wide fog options
  - DDFSECT Implementation
    - FOG_COLOR = \<color\>; Sets the sector's fog color to the RGB value of the provided colormap entry
    - FOG_DENSITY = \<0-100%\>; Sets the sector's fog density based on the provided percentage
  - UDMF Implementation
    - fadecolor = \<0xRRGGBB\>; Sets the sector's fog color to the hexadecimal RGB value provided
    - fogdensity = \<0-1020\>; Sets the sector's fog density according to GZDoom's usage of this parameter
      - Map editors may cap this value to 510; see docs/specifications/UDMF EDGE Extensions.txt for more details
  - RTS Sector Fog Commands
    - FOG_SECTOR \<tag\> \<color or SAME or CLEAR\> \<density(0-100%) or SAME or CLEAR\> ABSOLUTE
      - Color and density params match those in DDFSECT
      - SAME preserves the existing value; CLEAR sets it to the default (no fog) values
      - ABSOLUTE is an optional parameter; if absent then the density is changed relative to the existing fog density of the sector
        - Negative percentages are only allowed when performing relative density changes
  - DDFLEVL Implementation
    - INDOOR_FOG_COLOR = \<color\>; Sets the fog color for all indoor sectors to the RGB value of the provided colormap entry
    - INDOOR_FOG_DENSITY = \<0-100%\>; Sets the fog density for all indoor sectors to the provided percentage
    - OUTDOOR_FOG_COLOR = \<color\>; Sets the fog color for all outdoor sectors to the RGB value of the provided colormap entry
    - OUTDOOR_FOG_DENSITY = \<0-100%\>; Sets the fog density for all outdoor sectors to the provided percentage
- COALHUDS: Added hud.rts_disable function; same syntax as hud.rts_enable


General Improvements/Changes
--------------------
- Migrated to VGMPlay's libvgm from Game Music Emu
  - Support for AY, GBS, GYM, HES, NSF, SAP, and SPC filetypes has been removed
  - VGM support has been expanded to include all chipsets and systems supported by VGMPlay, with the
    exception of the WonderSwan
- DDFTHING: Implemented previously referenced WALL Glow Type
  - Same parameters as other glow types
  - Will only work on one linedef per glow mobj
    - Glow mobj must be touching the desired wall/linedef to be effective
- For standalone games, EDGEIWAD has been changed to EDGEGAME to account for the fact that
  a pack file may be used intsead of a WAD to distribute a game
- Auto-aim now targets "fuzzy" monsters i.e. Specters
- Improved Unicode path support for international locales
- DSSECRET lumps from PWADs (if present) will now override the built-in DSSECRET.ogg pack file
- Models will no longer be drawn if completely behind the view plane, reducing rendering overhead
- Voxel skins are now always uploaded with GL_NEAREST scaling instead of GL_LINEAR to preserve their intended look
- Plane movers are now disabled for sectors which have vertex slopes (this is not supported and caused very interesting results)
 

Bugs fixed
----------
- Fixed player health changes tied to voodoo doll damage and "Zombie Player" state not being achievable
- Fixed potential CTD when reading in *MAPINFO lumps
- Fixed potential CTD involving AJBSP split segs when they are part of a sector containing a UDMF vertex slope
- Migrated all model rendering to use VBOs regardless of rendering path (GL vs. GLES), fixing CTDs when
  the number of vertices for a model exceeded the size of the gl vertex array used by the unit rendering system
- Reverted to AJBSP 1.03's DetectOverlapping* methods to fix a situation where overlapping linedefs facing
  opposite directions would result in neither of them being rendered
- Fixed the PalettisedtoRGB function accepting PNG/JPG/TGA images and treating them as palettised.
- Fixed plane movers having unpredictable functionality when using a repeatable trigger type and
  already being at their destination height
- Migrated away from legacy SDL1 functions for interacting with sound devices, fixing possible
  race conditions when the device was not being locked or unlocked at the expected time
- Fixed weapon kick not working when mouselook was disabled
- Fixed CTD involving liquid swirl checks when debug_hom is set to 1
- Fixed pre-EC legacy issue: map AMBUSH flag was being lost if mobj was being replaced during 
  gameplay via BECOME
- Fixed RTS scripts using ON_DEATH conditions not working from a loaded game
- Fixed automap key display not showing Boom style locks
- Changed draw order of "Entering" and "You Are Here" intermission graphics to prevent the
  next level name from being obscured
- Fixed pre-EC legacy issue: crushed monsters never entered their GIB states
- Fixed pre-EC legacy issue: Cyberdeom was missing a frame in death states
