**EDGE-Classic** is a Doom source port that provides advanced features, ease of modding, and attractive visuals while keeping hardware requirements very modest. It is a revival of the [EDGE 1.35](http://edge.sourceforge.net/) codebase for modern systems.

[EMUS](http://firstgen.no-ip.info/emus/about.htm), the EDGE Modder's Utility Suite, has also been updated to stay current with EDGE-Classic's new features, and is an excellent all-in-one tool for both the beginning and experienced modder.

Here are some mods that showcase EDGE-Classic's flexibility and power:

## Operation: Arctic Wolf Revisited

Operation: Arctic Wolf Revisited is an update/extension of Laz Rojas' classic DOOM 2 mod with improved gameplay, all new weapons, enemies, new mechanics, more interactivity, more immersion, scripting, updated textures, level fixes, etc. making it essentially a whole new game.
