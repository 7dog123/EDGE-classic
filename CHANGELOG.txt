CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.1 (since EDGE-Classic 1.0)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------


General Improvements
--------------------
+ RTS Scripts can now use either a number or a string for their TAGs

+ Replaced GLEW with Glatter 

+ Converted drawing functions to use vertex arrays to reduce the number of GL calls needed (in progress)


New Features
------------
+ Added inventory system
  + DDF: INV01-INV25 are usable as PICKUP_BENEFIT options; syntax is the same as giving ammo
  + COAL: player.inventory_events(): event-based handling for keys based on Inventory Previous, Inventory Use, and Inventory Next bindings
  + COAL/RTS:  player.useinventory(): will call RTS script of appropriate tag when inventory item is used; naming convention for inventory script tags is INVENTORY1 - INVENTORY25

+ Heretic COALHUDS updated with game-approriate inventory display

+ Added 'autoload' folder which is scanned for valid file types on startup


CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.0 (since EDGE-Classic Preview 1)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
- Apple compilation now works, thanks to testing and PRs from atsb/Gibbon

- Dropping the console with a movement key held down would preserve that movement while in the console. Now toggling the console properly drops (movement) input

- Games with only one selectable episode will now skip episode selection and proceed directly to the skill choice menu. This prevents the "Hell on Earth" episode from appearing when it is not appropriate

- Fixed bug with valid skybox texture references being deleted when cycling between real and pseudo-skyboxes

- Downgraded textures without patches from being an error (ending the program) to a warning

- Fixed occasional bug where attempting to bind a key would map it to the wrong command

- Fixed bug where canceling out of an RTS Menu would instead select the first option; now it should exit with no result

- Fixed player being allowed to attempt to load a game from an empty slot

- Fixed inheritance for DDFWEAP

- Sloped sectors underneath an extrafloor will now actually use their slope instead of 0 (fix backported from EDGE 2.x)


General Improvements
--------------------
+ Creating a new Save Game with a blank name will now generate a default name (gamepad users can now create new saves without a keyboard)

+ "Found Secret" message now uses DDFLANG.

+ Berserk colour tint is no longer hardcoded and can be modified via DDFCOLM.

+ Merged CeeJay's LINES DDF with ours to create the ULTIMATE LINES DDF ;)

+ Replaced GLBSP with AJBSP as EDGE-Classic's internal nodebuilder

+ doom_ddf folder content merged into edge.wad and the folder removed. The past is the future...again ;)

+ Migrated from SDL1 to SDL2 for longevity and potential new features

+ Allow for FRONT/BACK to be recognized as RIGHT/LEFT textures in the RTS CHANGE_TEX function to suit modder preferences

+ Added missing graphics for Harmony and HacX option menus (Sound, Mouse, Gameplay, etc.) so that they don't use the fallback/incorrectly
paletted Doom menu graphics

+ Improved joystick/gamepad handling; added ability to map dpad (hat) buttons and analog triggers to actions

+ Added "Menu Navigation" option in Controls to bind Menu Open/Up/Down/Left/Right/Select/Cancel

+ Added cursor to navigate RTS menus and select options in addition to using the number keys.

+ Added ability to remap functions previously hardcoded to the function keys (Quicksave, Quickload, etc)


New Features
------------
+ MP3 Sound Effects Support

+ ATTACKS.DDF:
  -New attack type: DOUBLE_SPAWNER to mimic the pain elemental in Doom64.

+ THINGS.DDF: 
  -New SPECIAL flag: FLOOR_CLIP. This things sprites will always stick to the floor in the case that it's too tall for the sector it's in.

+ More game IWADs supported: HACX, Herectic, Harmony, Blasphemer
  -HACX: Full support. Includes bug fixes and widescreen support by CeeJay. Some graphics credited to HACX 2 team.
  -Harmony: Full support. May be some (hopefully) minor differences.
  -Heretic: Partial support. Item inventory not implemented in the base engine yet.
  -Blasphemer: Rudimentary support; less thorough compared to Heretic, but IWAD will now be recognized and launch.

+ Experimental floor offset: any linetype that uses the SPECIALs "ALIGN FLOOR" or "ALIGN CEILING", if the line has texture offsets applied then EDGE will use those to offset the floor flat.

+ COALHUDS: New command
  strings.find(s,TextToFind): will find a sub-string at ANY position. Returns position it was found at or -1 if not found.

+ Added water splash sfx to EDGEs default SWIM sectors.


CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic Preview 1 (since forking from EDGE 1.35)
====================================

Bugs fixed
----------
- TuttiFrutti effect. When the texture was shorter than the wall it was being applied to, the blank space was either filled with black or left invisible causing all sorts of graphical anomalies. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.

- OUCH face on the hud was using incorrect damage value.

- Face on hud never looked left because random number was never > 1.

- Linetypes [268](Monster-only Silent Teleport W1 (Boom)) and [269](Monster-only Silent Teleport WR (Boom)) were incorrectly set as PUSH instead of WALK.

- Sliding doors activated by monsters now make the appropriate SFX.

- Crash-to-desktop bug when using WEAKNESS class finally fixed.

- Black screen after endgame: backported from 2.x branch.

- oof sfx behaviour now closer to original doom.

General Improvements
--------------------
+ Added more ammotypes:  Now we have from AMMO01 to AMMO24.

+ Ignore COAL bobbing commands "cam.set_vert_bob" and "cam.set_roll_bob"

  -Revamped Overlay hud.
  -Removed AIRBAR graphics from edge.wad and rewrote the coal function to not use them.
  -Splash footsteps sfx when walking on liquid flats.

+ Lines.ddf
  -Edited all Slider doors to use BDOPN sfx.
  
+ Removed #VERSION check for both DDF and RTS. 

+ Made single option RTS MENUs respond to KEYD_JOY4 button.

+ Reduced Arachnotron width by 1. (Even though technically it is 64, this avoids issue with some pwads).

+ Reduced the lighting on several enemy attacks.

+ Default monitor ratio is set to 16:9 instead of 4:3 to accommodate most modern monitors.

+ Dynamic lighting, HQ2x, and Smoothing are now on by default to better highlight some of EDGE's rendering features.

+ Sliding doors now show on the Automap. 

+ Quietly ignore music lumps which aren't MIDI/OGG/MP3 instead of erroring out to Desktop.

+ Reduced the red tint while using the berserk power up.

+ M_SKULL1 menu cursor now uses DDFANIM (instead of being hardcoded to 2 frames). 

+ Much improved Doom skyboxes from https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=53873&hilit=doom+skyboxes

New Features
------------
+ THINGS.DDF: 
  -FALLING_SOUND for the player when they fall long distances. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
  -SECRET_SOUND entry for the player which plays when he enters a sector marked SECRET. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch. DSSECRET SFX from K8vavoom.
  -New SPECIAL flag: IMMORTAL. This thing never recieves damage from any attacks, but will go into pain states etc as usual.

+ WEAPONS.DDF: new DJNE weapon action for more robust weapon reloading. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
Used just like JUMP(state_name:frame,xx%), but decrements the reload quantity for the specified attack and jumps if it's not zero. The jump chance is now interpreted as the attack specifier: 0% is the primary attack ammo, and non-zero percent is the secondary attack ammo.
 
+ Lines.ddf
  -Edited all Slider doors to use BDOPN sfx.
  -Added Hub Exit switches: [2000] to [2039]

  - PLAYSOUND_BOSSMAN: sfx location now set on player.
  - New Command "EXIT_GAME": exits out of the map and back to the main title screen.

+ New MIDI Player
  - Timidity has been replaced by TinySoundfont, with support for *.sf2 soundfont files instead of GUS patch sets
  - A Roland Sound Canvas style default soundfont by Nando Florestan has been included (http://dev.nando.audio/pages/soundfonts.html).
Users with existing soundfonts can replace soundfont/default.sf2 with their own font if desired (must be named default.sf2; selector may be built in the future).
  - TinySoundfont is now the default music player for both Linux and Window builds. 

+ MP3 Music Support

+ Titlescreen and intermission are now Widescreen compatible with https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=67843

+ COALHUDS: 11 new commands
  player.kills() returns how many enemies killed on the current map.
  player.secrets() returns how many secrets discovered on current map.
  player.items() returns how many items picked up on the current map.
  player.map_enemies() returns total enemies on current map.
  player.map_secrets() returns total number of secrets on current map.
  player.map_items() returns total items on current map.
  player.floor_flat() returns the floor flat of the current sector we are in.
  player.sector_tag() returns the tag of the current sector we are in.
  hud.draw_number(x, y, len, num, align_right). hud.draw_num2() always 
    starts drawing the numbers from right-to-left. This new function 
    allows left-to right if we pass 0 for the align_right parameter, 
    or the usual draw_num2() right-to-left if we pass 1.
  math.random2() returns a random number between 0 and 10.
  hud.game_paused() returns 1 if the game is currently paused or 
    on the title menu screen.
