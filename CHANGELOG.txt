====================================


New Features
------------
- ATTACKS.DDF
  - New attack type - DUALATTACK
    - Can execute two independent attack definitions with a single state
    - New parameters (only required when using DUALATTACK):
      - DUALATTACK1=<string> - First dual attack definition
      - DUALATTACK2=<string> - Second dual attack definition
    - DUALATTACK1/2 must both be present, even if referring to the same attack
    - A dual attack can execute other dual attacks, but cannot reference itself
  - New attack type - PSYCHIC
    - Instant ranged direct damage attack
    - Will not cause infighting

- Implemented remaining MBF code pointers (A_FireOldBFG, A_BetaSkullAttack)


Bugs fixed
----------
- BOOM linetypes 143, 144, 148 and 149 fixed to use the correct Tx0/Tx changer type
