CHANGELOG for EDGE 1.35.1 (since 1.35)
====================================

(Date: NOVEMBER 2021)


Bugs fixed
----------

- TuttiFrutti effect. When the texture was shorter than the wall it was being applied to, the blank space was either filled with black or left invisible causing all sorts of graphical anomalies. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.

- OUCH face on the hud was using incorrect damage value.

- Face on hud never looked left because random number was never > 1.

- Linetypes [268](Monster-only Silent Teleport W1 (Boom)) and [269](Monster-only Silent Teleport WR (Boom)) were incorrectly set as PUSH instead of WALK.

- Sliding doors activated by monsters now make the appropriate SFX.

- Crash-to-desktop bug when using WEAKNESS class finally fixed.

- Black screen after endgame: backported from 2.x branch.

- oof sfx behaviour now closer to original doom.

New Features
------------

+ THINGS.DDF: 
  -FALLING_SOUND for the player when they fall long distances. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
  -SECRET_SOUND entry for the player which plays when he enters a sector marked SECRET. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch. DSSECRET SFX from K8vavoom.
  -New SPECIAL flag: IMMORTAL. This thing never recieves damage from any attacks, but will go into pain states etc as usual.

+ WEAPONS.DDF: new DJNE weapon action for more robust weapon reloading. Backported from EDGE 2.x branch.
Used just like JUMP(state_name:frame,xx%), but decrements the reload quantity for the specified attack and jumps if it's not zero. The jump chance is now interpreted as the attack specifier: 0% is the primary attack ammo, and non-zero percent is the secondary attack ammo.

  -New attack type: DOUBLE_SPAWNER to mimic the pain elemental in Doom64.
  
+ Lines.ddf
  -Edited all Slider doors to use BDOPN sfx.
  -Added Hub Exit switches: [2000] to [2039]

  - PLAYSOUND_BOSSMAN: sfx location now set on player.
  - New Command "EXIT_GAME": exits out of the map and back to the main title screen.

+ New MIDI Player
  - Timidity has been replaced by TinySoundfont, with support for *.sf2 soundfont files instead of GUS patch sets
  - A Roland SC-55 style default soundfont by Deemster has been included (https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=45600).
Users with existing soundfonts can replace soundfont/default.sf2 with their own font if desired (must be named default.sf2; selector is in progress).

+ COALHUDS: 11 new commands
  player.kills() returns how many enemies killed on the current map.
  player.secrets() returns how many secrets discovered on current map.
  player.items() returns how many items picked up on the current map.
  player.map_enemies() returns total enemies on current map.
  player.map_secrets() returns total number of secrets on current map.
  player.map_items() returns total items on current map.

  hud.draw_number(x, y, len, num, align_right). hud.draw_num2() always 
    starts drawing the numbers from right-to-left. This new function 
    allows left-to right if we pass 0 for the align_right parameter, 
    or the usual draw_num2() right-to-left if we pass 1.
  math.random2() returns a random number between 0 and 10.
  hud.game_paused() returns 1 if the game is currently paused or 
    on the title menu screen.
