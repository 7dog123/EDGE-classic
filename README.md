**EDGE-Classic** is a Doom source port that provides advanced features, ease of modding, and attractive visuals while keeping hardware requirements very modest. It is a revival of the [EDGE 1.35](http://edge.sourceforge.net/) codebase for modern systems.

[EMUS](http://firstgen.no-ip.info/emus/about.htm), the EDGE Modder's Utility Suite, has also been updated to stay current with EDGE-Classic's new features, and is an excellent all-in-one tool for both the beginning and experienced modder.

Here are some mods that showcase EDGE-Classic's flexibility and power:

## Operation: Arctic Wolf Revisited

A 19-level Total Conversion for Doom 2 set in the Wolfenstein 3D universe.

_For months now, Allied Intelligence has suspected that the German navy has been attempting to construct a nuclear-powered submarine somewhere in the Arctic Circle that would rule the Atlantic and threaten the east coast of the United States. The existence of this submarine, codenamed Seeteufel (Sea Devil), has been confirmed. Reconnaissance photos have pinpointed the site where this sub is being built as a u-boat base in a fjord in northern Norway, and although several spies have been dispatched to this location, none of them has been heard from again. Your mission is to infiltrate the base, rescue these missing operatives, and destroy the new submarine before its construction is completed._

An action-packed gameplay mod that puts you in the boots of the political incorrect but lovable ass-kicking macho-man Duke Nukem. Crammed full of of 80's/90's action movie throwbacks and pop culture references. Featuring an impressive arsenal of super deadly, sneaky and devastating weapons and a colorful and humorous collection of power-ups and pickups. Full of witty one-liners from Duke himself and plenty of blood, guts and gore.
