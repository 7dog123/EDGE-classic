CHANGELOG for EDGE-Classic 1.36 (since EDGE-Classic 1.35)
====================================


New Features
------------
- ATTACKS.DDF: DAMAGE_UNLESS_BENEFIT and DAMAGE_IF_BENEFIT subcommands added
  - Can be used anywhere that DAMAGE is used (sectors, attacks, etc)
  - DAMAGE.DAMAGE_UNLESS_BENEFIT: Player will take damage unless they have at least one of the benefits listed
  - DAMAGE.DAMAGE_IF_BENEFIT: Player will take damage if they have at least one of the benefits listed
  
- WEAPONS.DDF: Can now define a 3RD and 4TH attack. Equivalent DDF syntax to SEC_xxx used for second attack
	 DDF Fields: 
	 - 3RD_ATTACK, 3RD_AMMOTYPE, 3RD_AMMOPERSHOT, 3RD_CLIPSIZE, 3RD_AUTOMATIC, 3RD_SPECIAL
	 - 4TH_ATTACK, 4TH_AMMOTYPE, 4TH_AMMOPERSHOT, 4TH_CLIPSIZE, 4TH_AUTOMATIC, 4TH_SPECIAL
	 
	 DDF States:
	 - 3RD_ATTACK, 3RD_RELOAD, 3RD_DISCARD, 3RD_WARMUP, 3RD_FLASH
	 - 4TH_ATTACK, 4TH_RELOAD, 4TH_DISCARD, 4TH_WARMUP, 4TH_FLASH
	 
	 DDF Actions:
	 - 3RD_SHOOT, 3RD_REFIRE, 3RD_NOFIRE, 3RD_NOFIRE_RETURN, 3RD_CHECKRELOAD, 3RD_FLASH
	 - 4TH_SHOOT, 4TH_REFIRE, 4TH_NOFIRE, 4TH_NOFIRE_RETURN, 4TH_CHECKRELOAD, 4TH_FLASH
	 
	For consistency, all the old SEC_xxx ddf commands can also be used with 2ND_xxx instead 
	  i.e. 2ND_AMMOTYPE can replace SEC_AMMOTYPE

- ATTACKS.DDF: Attack special "PLAYER_ATTACK" makes attack behave as if originating from the 
  player, even if it's an indirect secondary attack i.e. the player gets his VAMPIRE health and KillBenefits.


General Improvements/Changes
--------------------
- Windowed Mode resolution list will now dynamically populate based off of available display information instead of using presets
- Video Options crosshair selection will not be shown when switching to/from weapons that have DDF custom crosshairs
- Slightly re-organized the Key binding menu to accomodate the new 3rd and 4th attacks.
- Implemented 'episode' UMAPINFO key; EDGE-Classic now fully supports the UMAPINFO spec, Revision 2.2

Bugs fixed
----------
- Legacy bugfix: Boom generalized sector types were not preserved when saving/loading levels with said sectors
- Fixed assertion failure when referencing DSDehacked frames past the last frame explicitly defined in the [CODEPTR] section
- Fixed viewpoint modified by the r_fov CVAR not changing the vertical view slope appropriately
- Fixed region properties not working properly with a vertex sloped floor that rises above its sector's original floor height
- Fixed occasional sector glow thing link/unlink errors
