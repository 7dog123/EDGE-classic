# EDGE-classic
Fork of the EDGE 1.35 release

# Current Status
Main program builds under MSYS2 for Windows executables. Linux compilation is working as well, but there are likely some bugs to squash.

There is now an included soundfont and timidity.cfg for immediate use (Patches are derived from the TimGM6mb Musescore soundfont)
