# EDGE-classic
Fork of the EDGE 1.35 release

# Current Status
Main program builds under MSYS2 now, but need to fix icon registration, edge.wad building, and doom_ddf folder assembly. The latter two can be copied over from the original 1.35 release. Will post build guide when I clean a few things up.
